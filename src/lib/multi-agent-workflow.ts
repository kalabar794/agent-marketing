/**
 * In-memory multi‑agent job store and scheduler.
 *
 * This module manages multi‑agent jobs created by the content creation UI.
 * When a job is created via the API, it is assigned a unique `jobId` and
 * an initial status along with a list of agents. The job is then
 * automatically progressed over time to simulate each agent performing its
 * work. Consumers can poll the current job status via the `getJob` API.
 *
 * Note: This implementation uses a simple in-memory Map to persist job
 * state across API requests. In a serverless or edge environment the
 * state may not persist across cold starts; for a production system you
 * should replace this with a durable storage mechanism such as a database
 * or Redis.
